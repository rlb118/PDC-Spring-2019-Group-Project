                One of the key elements of data collected from the Rotten Tomatoes data set is the Box Office Gross of many of the films within. When shown alongside release year, it’s rapidly apparent that the general trend for the films in the list to remain in the same general gross bracket of under $10M, though there are clearly several exceptions to this, in addition to the large volume of data that lacks gross values. Overall, however, only five films broke $100M, and two of them are from the same franchise. 
                <br>
                <br>
                From this trend, we can gather draw several possible conclusions and hypothesize about the reasons behind them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                First and foremost, the films that tend to get consistently high reviews from the critics are cult/indie films, classics, and documentaries.  This is likely a result of the sheer overwhelming number of reviews many of the more popular films listed get, which tends to guarantee a handful of naysayers to bring the score down from the perfect 100%.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another observation of note is that, despite the general inflation of USD, the general gross has remained largely the same. A trend like this could have many possible explanations, ranging from tying in to the hypothesis from the first observation of the review quantity to the idea that the bar may be lower for films that gross less, as the critics may have had lower expectations going in. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A final observation of note is that the films that broke $50M were from a wide range of decades, which shows that the gross and decades are even more unrelated. It’s very possible that a handful of the older films like Pinocchio made much of their money over the decades that followed through the various other avenues of purchase, but for the most part the films listed didn’t have the status of “Classic” that such a film provides. This, in turn, means that a greater breakdown into trends regarding films across decades is needed, which will be discussed later on in the article.
                <br>
                <br>
                The largest issue with this portion of the dataset is the lack of full information: many of the films have little-to-no box office data, and, as such, may skew the graph. In order to still allow the films to appear on the timeline, they were given supplementary values of $1.00.

                Our main mission in sorting through all of the data we’ve collected for these films has been to try to find any patterns to how these films have been “graded,” so to speak, over time. One of the first patterns we looked for was just how many films have been given 100% ratings by film critics throughout each decade. Perhaps if we could isolate this data, it would be easier to discover other factors that have had an influence on how films have been rated over the years - and this turned out to be true.
                <br>
                <br>
                Initially, the data on the number of films that received a 100% critic approval per decade didn’t seem all that significant. A bit surprising, maybe, but not all that significant. The pie chart above shows each decade with the proportion of films that received a 100% rating.
                <br>
                <br>
                Contrary to what we believed the outcome of our data would be before we’d even collected it, the proportions of earlier films that have received 100% critic approval are not the highest out of all the data. The 1920’s, which were the earliest recorded decade we have in this dataset, only saw perfect scores for 9 out of the 365 films we have in our dataset. Compared with the 130 films from this current decade that have achieved perfect scores, at first glance, it seems as though our predictions have been flip-flopped.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking closer, however, there’s likely a very logical reason for this: the longer a film has been in existence, the more time it has had to be exposed to more critics, any of whom has the potential to lower the rating. Based on this, it actually makes a lot of sense for there to be the least number of 100%-rated films from the earliest decade and the most number of 100%-rated films from the most recent decade. Because more recent films have not been exposed to the kind of long-term scrutiny that older films have, they are much more likely to slip through the cracks of criticism - at least for now. As time goes on, we’re sure that some of the films produced in the past decade will begin to fall off this list.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are, of course, other explanations for these numbers as well. For instance, it may just be that back in the 1920’s, when cinema was just starting to take off as a new form of storytelling and artistic expression, there just weren’t all that many films being produced in the first place. The technology would have been new and difficult to come by, so it’s likely that the volume of films being produced was much lower than what we are used to in an age where you can film an entire movie on an iPhone. With more accessible means of film production at our fingertips today, the potential for a film to earn a perfect score is greater than ever.
                <br>
                <br>
                One rather peculiar facet of our data is the dip in the number of films to receive a perfect score in the 70s and 80s. Before then, somewhere between 30-40 films had fairly consistently been receiving 100% ratings, but this number dropped down to 20 films per decade for the subsequent years. The reason this isn’t all that clear, but we would speculate that it may have something to do with the rise of what we’d call “feel-good” films today. These are films that typically make a point of appealing more to the general public than to critics. They are made primarily for entertainment purposes, and entertainment purposes alone. The aspects of film that critics paid careful attention to, such as cinematography, sound, and composition, are put on the backburner in favor of things that appease the public, such as engaging characters and funny storylines.
